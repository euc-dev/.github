# Omnissa Developer and OSS Repository Documentation

This Organization hosts repositories for the [Omnissa Developer Portal](https://developer.omnissa.com) including the repositories that contain documentation for the tools, SDKs, and samples scripts published on the [Omnissa Developer Portal](https://developer.omnissa.com).

All projects welcome contributions from any member of our community. To get started contributing, please see our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Also please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/Developer%20Certificate%20of%20Origin.md) before contributing. All contributions to this repository ***must*** be signed off, as described within the Developer Certificate of Origin. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

## Repository Structure

Each documentation set is self-contained within its own repository in MarkDown format, and feeds into the [Omnissa Developer Portal GitHub repo](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) as submodules. 

Only pages within the `/docs` folder should be modified within each repo. All other files are used to support the MkDocs and the Material theme to render the site in GitHub Pages.

## New Documentation Set

Requests for a new documentation set should be sent to [Omnissa Developer Portal](mailto:developer-portal@omnissa.com?subject=New%20Documentation%20Request), and instructions will be provided via reply email.
