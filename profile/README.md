# Welcome to the Omnissa Developer Portal Organisation

This Organization hosts repositories for the Omnissa Developer Portal including the repositories that contain documentation for the tools, SDKs, and samples scripts published on the [Omnissa Developer Portal](https://developer.omnissa.com).

Each documentation set is self-contained within its own repository and all projects welcome contributions from any member of our community. To get started contributing, please see our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Also please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/euc-dev/.github/blob/main/Developer%20Certificate%20of%20Origin.md) before contributing. All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

Requests for a new documentation set should be sent to [Omnissa Developer Portal](mailto:developer-portal@omnissa.com?subject=New%20Documentation%20Request), and instructions will be provided via reply email.
